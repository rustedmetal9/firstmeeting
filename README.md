-And she was mine, she was mine, the key was in my fist, my fist was in my pocket, she was mine.

The pain of concrete against skin. The burn of flesh, blood heating up the wound even more by pouring out of the sensitive material ever so slowly. Head rushing, vision blurring, the sounds of screaming and the ringing inside her ears was deafening. Red liquid dripped down onto the broken concrete, her body feeling heavy, barely even being able to hold her torso up. She looked up, her vision hazing yet again, the sight of an unfamiliar uniform- something she’s never seen before in her short life, walking towards her with confidence, the same red liquid dripping down his metallic tendrils. Her head feels more and more heavy, falling on her limbs as she succumbs to her lethargy. 

She didn’t dream anything, only seeing black for a few minutes before her eyes forced themselves open. It was all strange, unfamiliar, the smell violating her nose as something out of a hospital. She let out a little audible Blegh before hearing the sound of someone nearby. She sharply turned her head towards the sound, attempting to get up and move before feeling the restraints on her body. Panic went through her body yet again, looking down and finding the lower part of her bodysuit had been crudely torn off. Her stomach and chest twisted and turned, seeing the bruises on her thighs and waist. What happened while she was out? Millions of words went through her head, not paying attention to the approaching footsteps. 

“Good morning, little one!”

The man said, kneeling down with a smile. She looked up at him, his calm amber eyes shaking her to her core. The person who caused so much destruction, who most likely killed her friends and so many others- looking so innocently at her, like a teacher would.  She hesitantly squeaked out a response, a little G-Good.. Morning…. Escaping her soft, dirty lips. He let out a little laugh, petting her messy hair much like how someone would pet a small dog. 

“Hah, you’re so cute. What’s your name?”

She didn’t respond, just letting the older man ruffle her hair. At least he had the courtesy of tying her to some sort of sofa. She looked away, her yellow and red swirled eyes shaking along with her heart. The man stared at her yet again, humming some unfamiliar tune as he thought. 


“....”
“...M..Miharu…”
“Oh! What a cute name.”

He pulled away his hand. 

“You need a bath.”

“H-Huh-?”

He said suddenly, untying the girl and holding her arm. The whole building was strange- was this his home? No-

She looked out at the windows, stars, various milky-way esque shapes outside. This was a ship. She didn’t speak as the man dragged her to a large bathroom, obviously made for multiple people. It unnerved her, being alone in what seems to be a group ship with this man. He turned to her, squatting yet again and taking her large overshirt off. She squealed in response, quickly covering her bottom half. He laughed again, forcing her arms open so he could take the tattered black bodysuit off as well. She was shaking, her face red as she looked away. The man didn’t seem to mind, moving her into the open shower. It was all so quick and oppressive, the smell of chemicals and the aura of oppression, like being trapped in a mousetrap. As he played with some buttons on a screen, the feeling of cold water splashed onto her bruised skin. 

She let out a squeal, her body shivering as it dripped onto her skin, holding her arms to her sides. She quivered, being turned around to face the stranger. She opened her eyes for a few seconds, the man now dressed in something more casual- was he always dressed like this? His now gloveless hand was squeezing some sort of cream into the other. Was it shampoo? Or bodywash? Her internal question was answered as he rubbed the pearl-colored cream into her dirty and messy hair. It did need a good wash, having dirt and blood mixed in it. She stood there, his hands massaging and running through her thick hair. 

It felt nice. 

Her stomach turned at the thought, her chest sinking in itself. What? What did she just think? Her eyes tightened, biting her lip as her hands twitched, the pressure inside contradicting the nice feeling of the man cleaning her hair. She couldn’t understand, she couldn’t understand why she thought that. Though, she was brought outside back into the world with the man speaking. 

“You have such nice hair. Green and black is a good combination.”

His voice sounded so calm, earnest. She couldn’t wrap her head around it. His accent was soothing, alluring like the hug from your mother on a bad day. She liked it, she wanted to hear more praise from this strange, horrible man.

“T..Thank you.”

She said, the sour taste of shampoo entering her mouth as she let out another quick Blegh!, the man laughing in return. It all felt so comfortable, cozy, familiar- in this strange, exotic ship. She didn’t know what to think. 

After the shampoo, he washed with conditioner, and then the bodywash. The soap stung her now cold wounds, squirming at the feeling, being calmed down by the grown man. It was all quick, the drying part being the most confusing, after a few minutes she was completely dry. Her hair was much brighter in comparison, his calloused hands running through it. He hummed, brushing her thick black and green hair. Despite being fully naked in front of this stranger- a stranger she didn’t even know the name of, she felt… calm. A calm she hasn’t felt in her short 13 years of life. 

“You have such beautiful hair, Miharu.”

He said again, her heart beating quicker in response. She didn’t know if she could thank him again, but she went against her better judgment and mumbled out a Thank you yet again.

“Hah! You’re so polite.”

Her face reddened with his words. 

“S..Sir… Can I… ask.. What is your name…?”

He thought for a moment. 

“My name is Strade!”

His smile remained, getting up from the bathroom stool as Miharu looked up. He grabbed her arm yet again, dragging her to another strange room before she could respond, this new room being some sort of bedroom area, various bunk beds around- attached to the walls, like shelves. On the other side of the wall were shelves, organized to be for each person aboard. Her stomach sank, but something told her to not press on why he was the only person here. As she stood there, he rummaged through a shelf to find something. He brought out a white tank top, his smile widening. 

“It’ll do for now. I’ll need to get some clothes for you, but you can just hold onto me if you’re cold.”

He said, walking towards her with the too big tank top. He put it on her, caring no mind to messing up her just-brushed hair. The shirt stopped at the end of her inner thighs, not covering much of the bruising around her knees and thighs. She didn’t mind it, not being different from what she usually wears to sleep. The urge to speak merged up again, her eyes racing around the room before she opened her lips yet again. 

“T..Thank you, Strade.”


She said, gripping onto the bottom of her new shirt. She bit her lip, no immediate response made her heart shake. He smiled wider, his white teeth showing, along with his sharp fangs. 

“You’re welcome! Hah, you’re so polite!”

Her face reddened more at this response, looking down yet again. Like it was routine at this point, the older man grabbed her arm, heading towards another area of this house-sized ship. This time, It was a kitchen area, a little dining room in view first. She hadn’t eaten anything in a good while, her stomach letting out a low growl. 

“Hungry? You’ve been out for a while… you want a snack?”

She nodded, holding her stomach with her free hand. He let go of her arm, going into the little kitchen area, going through some drawers to find something. He brought out a chocolatey protein bar, holding two in each hand for her. She reached up for a bar, he handed it to her. She opened it with haste, taking a bite out of it. Her eyes widened, it might’ve been the fact she hadn’t eaten in a while, but it felt like the best thing she had eaten in months. She quickly took more bites, Strade chuckling as he watched. Soon, the entire chocolatey protein bar was gone. She put her hand to her stomach, the emptiness was still there, croaking,, but she didn’t want to pester him. She followed him to the trash can, throwing away her trash before he grabbed her arm again. It was starting to feel normal, now.
